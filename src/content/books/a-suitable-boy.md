A Suitable Boy is one of the longest novels ever published in a single volume in English. Set in post-independence India of the early 1950s, it follows four families over 18 months as Mrs. Rupa Mehra searches for a suitable husband for her younger daughter Lata.

Through the lives of these families, Vikram Seth paints a sprawling portrait of newly independent India grappling with Hindu-Muslim tensions, land reforms, political upheavals, and the collision between tradition and modernity.
