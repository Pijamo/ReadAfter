R.S. Aggarwal's *Quantitative Aptitude* is the undisputed heavyweight champion of Indian competitive exam mathematics. For over three decades, this book has been the first resource that students reach for when preparing for the quantitative sections of virtually every competitive examination in India — from banking and SSC to CAT and UPSC CSAT. Its longevity is a testament to its thoroughness, clarity, and the trust that generations of successful candidates have placed in it.

The book covers the entire spectrum of quantitative topics tested in Indian competitive exams: number systems, HCF and LCM, fractions, square roots, averages, percentages, profit and loss, ratio and proportion, partnership, time and work, pipes and cisterns, time and distance, trains, boats and streams, simple and compound interest, area and volume, permutations and combinations, probability, data interpretation, and data sufficiency. Each chapter follows a consistent structure — theory, solved examples, and extensive practice exercises arranged in increasing order of difficulty.

What has made Aggarwal's book endure is its focus on shortcuts and tricks that save precious minutes in timed examinations. Beyond mere formulas, Aggarwal teaches problem-solving approaches — when to use direct calculation, when to use elimination, when to substitute values — that reflect the tactical thinking required to clear competitive exams where speed is as important as accuracy. The sheer volume of practice problems, numbering in the thousands, ensures that students encounter virtually every type of question they might face.

## Why Indian Readers Love This Book

In India's intensely competitive exam ecosystem, where lakhs of candidates compete for thousands of positions, *Quantitative Aptitude* by R.S. Aggarwal is the great equalizer. It does not assume an IIT-level mathematical background — it builds from fundamentals, making it accessible to students from Hindi-medium schools and small-town colleges who form the backbone of India's competitive exam aspirant pool. The book's accessibility and comprehensiveness have made it a household name, passed down from elder siblings to younger ones like a family heirloom.

## Who Should Read This

- Students preparing for banking exams (IBPS PO, SBI PO, RBI Assistant) who need comprehensive quantitative practice
- SSC (CGL, CHSL) and railway exam aspirants looking for a single, reliable resource for mathematics preparation
- CAT and MBA entrance exam candidates who want to strengthen their fundamentals before moving to advanced problem-solving
