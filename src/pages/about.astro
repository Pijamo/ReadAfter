      <p>
        <strong>ReadAfter</strong> helps Indian readers discover their next great read. We curate book recommendations
        across fiction, non-fiction, self-help, business, technology, and more — with a focus on what resonates
        with readers in India.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Pick Books</h2>
      <p>
        Our recommendations are based on reader ratings, critical acclaim, and relevance to Indian audiences.
        We focus on books that are readily available to buy in India through Amazon and Flipkart.
      </p>

      <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        ReadAfter is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Associates Programme</strong> and <strong>Flipkart Affiliate Programme</strong>.
        This means that when you click on a link to Amazon or Flipkart from our site and make a purchase, we may
        earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This commission helps us keep the site running and continue providing free book recommendations.
        We only recommend books we genuinely believe are worth reading — our recommendations are never influenced
        by affiliate partnerships.
