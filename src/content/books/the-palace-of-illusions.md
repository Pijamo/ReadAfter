The Palace of Illusions retells the epic Mahabharata from the perspective of Draupadi — the woman at the heart of the story who is often sidelined in traditional retellings. Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni gives voice to one of Indian mythology's most complex female characters.

From Draupadi's birth in fire to the destruction of her magnificent palace, this novel reimagines the ancient epic through a deeply feminist and humanizing lens.

## Why Indian Readers Love This Book

It gives Indian readers a fresh perspective on a story they've known since childhood. Seeing the Mahabharata through Draupadi's eyes reveals emotional depths and feminine perspectives that traditional retellings miss.

## Who Should Read This

- Readers who enjoy mythological retellings
- Anyone interested in feminist perspectives on classic stories
- Fans of Amish Tripathi or Devdutt Pattanaik
