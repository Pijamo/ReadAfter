Norman Lewis's *Word Power Made Easy* has been transforming vocabularies for over seven decades, and its popularity shows no signs of diminishing. First published in 1949, this book takes a radically different approach to vocabulary building. Instead of presenting words as isolated items to be memorized through repetition, Lewis groups them by the ideas they express and teaches readers the Latin and Greek roots from which English words are constructed. Learn one root, and you unlock dozens of words.

The book is organized into sessions, each focusing on a cluster of related concepts. A chapter on personality types, for instance, teaches words like "egoist," "altruist," "introvert," "ambivert," "misogynist," and "misanthrope" — not as a random list but as a family of words connected by their roots and meanings. Lewis then drills these words through exercises that test not just recognition but active usage: choosing the right word, spelling correctly, and understanding nuances.

Lewis's writing style is warm, engaging, and almost conversational — a remarkable achievement for a vocabulary textbook. He anticipates the reader's confusion, provides mnemonics, tells etymological stories, and builds complexity gradually. The result is not a reference book to be consulted but a course to be worked through — Lewis explicitly tells readers to spend time on each session, do all the exercises, and resist the temptation to skip ahead. This discipline pays extraordinary dividends.

## Why Indian Readers Love This Book

*Word Power Made Easy* enjoys cult-like devotion in India, where English proficiency is often perceived as a gateway to professional success. For competitive exam aspirants — GRE, CAT, banking, SSC — the book is virtually mandatory. But its appeal extends far beyond exam preparation. Indian professionals in IT, consulting, and media use it to polish their communication skills, and college students across the country discover it as the single most effective tool for elevating their English. At under 200 rupees, it is also one of the best value propositions in Indian bookselling.

## Who Should Read This

- Professionals who communicate in English daily and want to express themselves with greater precision and confidence
