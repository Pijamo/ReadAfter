# Retire Rich by P.V. Subramanyam — The Retirement Guide India Actually Deserves

Retirement planning in India has long been an afterthought. For previous generations, it was simple — work for the government, get a pension, live modestly. But the pension system has been dismantled for most government employees hired after 2004, and the private sector never had one to begin with. If you are a salaried professional in India today, your retirement is entirely your responsibility. *Retire Rich* by P.V. Subramanyam is the book that shows you exactly how to take that responsibility seriously.

## Why Most Indians Are Not Ready to Retire

The numbers are stark. According to various industry surveys, less than 30% of Indian working professionals have any retirement plan beyond their EPF. Most people assume their provident fund will be enough. It will not. A person earning 1 lakh per month with an EPF balance of 40 lakh at retirement might think they are set. But at a 6% inflation rate, that 40 lakh will have the purchasing power of roughly 10 lakh in 25 years. That is not a retirement corpus — it is a crisis waiting to happen.

Subramanyam, a chartered accountant and one of India's most respected personal finance bloggers, understands this problem intimately. He has spent decades advising middle-class Indian families on retirement planning, and this book distills that experience into a practical, actionable guide that does not require an MBA to understand.

## EPF, PPF, and NPS: The Indian Retirement Trinity

The book's greatest strength is its detailed treatment of India-specific retirement instruments. Subramanyam walks you through each one with clarity and precision.

**EPF (Employees' Provident Fund):** Most salaried Indians have EPF deducted from their salary, but few understand how it works. Subramanyam explains the contribution structure, the interest rate mechanism, the tax treatment, and most importantly, why you should never withdraw your EPF when changing jobs. Every premature withdrawal resets your compounding clock, and the cost over a 30-year career can easily run into tens of lakhs.

**PPF (Public Provident Fund):** The PPF is one of India's best tax-saving instruments, offering EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) status — your contribution is tax-deductible, the interest is tax-free, and the maturity amount is tax-free. Subramanyam shows how maxing out your PPF contribution of 1.5 lakh per year and extending the account beyond 15 years can create a substantial debt component in your retirement portfolio.

**NPS (National Pension System):** The NPS is the most misunderstood retirement product in India. Many people avoid it because of the mandatory annuity component at maturity. Subramanyam provides a balanced assessment — the additional tax deduction of 50,000 rupees under Section 80CCD(1B) makes it attractive, the equity allocation can boost returns, but the annuity rules need careful navigation. He explains how to choose the right fund manager, the right asset allocation, and the right exit strategy.

## The SIP Strategy: Small Amounts, Massive Results

One of the most compelling sections of the book is Subramanyam's treatment of SIPs in equity mutual funds as a retirement tool. He presents tables and calculations that make the power of compounding viscerally real. A monthly SIP of 10,000 rupees in a diversified equity fund, started at age 25 and continued until age 55 with an assumed return of 12% per annum, grows to approximately 3.5 crore. Start the same SIP at age 35, and you get roughly 1 crore. That 10-year delay costs you 2.5 crore. The numbers are not theoretical — they are based on historical Sensex returns, and while past performance does not guarantee future results, the directional truth is undeniable.

Subramanyam also addresses the behavioral challenge of SIPs. Starting is easy. Continuing through market crashes, job losses, and life emergencies is hard. He advocates for treating your SIP as a non-negotiable expense, the same way you treat your rent or EMI. You do not skip your home loan payment because the market is down. Your SIP deserves the same discipline.

## Planning for Indian Realities

What sets *Retire Rich* apart from generic retirement advice is its sensitivity to Indian life realities. Subramanyam accounts for the fact that many Indians financially support their parents, fund their children's education and weddings, and deal with healthcare costs that can wipe out years of savings in a single hospitalization. He does not pretend these obligations do not exist. Instead, he shows you how to plan around them — building an emergency fund of at least 6 months' expenses, getting adequate health insurance with a super top-up, and ring-fencing your retirement corpus so that it is the last thing you touch.

He also addresses the emotional side of retirement planning, which most finance books ignore. The fear of not having enough, the guilt of prioritizing your retirement over your children's demands, the social pressure to keep up appearances — Subramanyam acknowledges these pressures and provides a framework for making decisions that are financially sound even when they are socially uncomfortable.

## The Bottom Line

*Retire Rich* is not a glamorous book. It will not teach you to trade options or pick multi-bagger stocks. It is a book about discipline, patience, and the quiet power of starting early and staying consistent. For the Indian salaried professional who wants to retire with dignity and financial independence — not dependent on children, not anxious about medical bills, not counting every rupee — this book provides the roadmap. It is specific, practical, and deeply rooted in the Indian financial ecosystem. If you are in your 20s or 30s and have not started planning for retirement, stop reading this review and start reading the book. Every year you delay makes the mountain steeper.
