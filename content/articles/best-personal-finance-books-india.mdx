Money is one of those topics most Indian families don't discuss openly — and that's exactly why so many of us enter adulthood financially unprepared. Whether you're a fresh graduate starting your first job or a seasoned professional who still doesn't understand where the salary goes each month, these books will change how you think about money.

We've selected these 5 books with the Indian reader in mind. Two of them are written specifically about the Indian financial system, while the others offer universal wisdom that applies beautifully to Indian contexts.

## Why Financial Literacy Matters in India

India's financial landscape has changed dramatically. UPI, mutual fund SIPs, digital gold, and crypto are all at your fingertips. But without financial literacy, having access to these tools is like having a kitchen full of ingredients without knowing how to cook.

These books won't make you rich overnight. But they'll give you the mental frameworks to make better decisions with every rupee you earn.

## Our Top Picks

### 1. Let's Talk Money by Monika Halan

This is the book we wish every Indian college student received at graduation. Monika Halan, one of India's most respected personal finance journalists, breaks down everything you need to know — from health insurance to mutual funds — in language anyone can understand.

What makes this book special is that it's entirely India-specific. She talks about LIC policies, EPF, PPF, and the real math behind endowment plans (spoiler: they're usually not worth it). If you read just one book from this list, make it this one.

### 2. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

This isn't a "how to invest" book. It's a "how to think about money" book. Housel argues that doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.

For Indian readers, the chapters on compounding and on the difference between being wealthy and being rich are particularly eye-opening. It explains why your neighbor with the flashy car might be less financially secure than the quiet uncle who drives a Maruti.

### 3. Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki

Love it or debate it, this book has introduced more people to financial thinking than any other. Kiyosaki's core lesson — understand the difference between assets and liabilities — is something most salaried Indians don't learn until it's too late.

Take the specific investment advice with a grain of salt (the book is American-centric), but the mindset shift it creates about money, employment, and building wealth is genuinely transformative.

### 4. The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham

If you're investing in Indian stock markets — or planning to — this is your textbook. Benjamin Graham's principles of value investing influenced Warren Buffett and practically every successful investor since.

It's a dense read, but the concepts of margin of safety, Mr. Market, and the difference between investing and speculating are timeless. Indian investors navigating the volatility of Sensex and Nifty will find Graham's calm, rational approach deeply reassuring.

### 5. Retire Rich by P.V. Subramanyam

Most retirement advice online is American and doesn't account for India's unique financial instruments. Subramanyam fills this gap beautifully. He explains how to use EPF, PPF, NPS, and mutual fund SIPs to build a retirement corpus that actually works in Indian conditions.

This is especially valuable for Indians in their 20s and 30s who think retirement planning can wait. Spoiler: it can't, and this book will show you exactly why.
