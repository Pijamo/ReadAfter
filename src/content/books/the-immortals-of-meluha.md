The Immortals of Meluha is the first book in Amish Tripathi's blockbuster Shiva Trilogy, which reimagines the Hindu god Shiva as a Tibetan immigrant who arrives in the land of Meluha. What begins as a simple migration story transforms into an epic tale of war, love, philosophy, and destiny.

Set in 1900 BCE, the Meluhans face a grave threat from the Chandravanshis and the mysterious Nagas. When Shiva's throat turns blue after drinking the sacred Somras, the Meluhans believe he is the prophesied Neelkanth who will save their civilization.
