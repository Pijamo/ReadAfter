*The Pragmatic Programmer* by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt is widely considered one of the most important books ever written about the craft of software development. First published in 1999 and thoroughly updated in 2019 for its 20th anniversary edition, this book transcends any particular language, framework, or methodology to address the fundamental question: what does it mean to be a good programmer?

The book is organized as a series of loosely connected topics — 53 in the anniversary edition — each offering a practical principle for becoming a more effective developer. The famous "DRY" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) originated here, as did concepts like "programming by coincidence," "tracer bullets," and the "broken windows theory" applied to codebases. Thomas and Hunt write with a mentor's voice — firm but encouraging, opinionated but never dogmatic.

What makes this book endure is its focus on the developer as a thinking professional rather than a code-producing machine. Topics range from the deeply technical (text manipulation, code generators, design by contract) to the deeply human (managing expectations, communicating with stakeholders, taking ownership of your career). The anniversary edition updates examples and adds new topics around concurrency, security, and the changing landscape of software development while preserving the spirit that made the original a classic.
