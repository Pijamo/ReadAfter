Devdutt Pattanaik's *Jaya* is the most accessible and comprehensive retelling of the Mahabharata available in modern English. Unlike novelistic retellings that focus on a single character or storyline, Pattanaik presents the entire epic — from the origins of the Kuru dynasty to the ascent of the Pandavas to heaven — in a format that is both encyclopedic and readable. Each chapter is self-contained, covering a specific episode, and is accompanied by Pattanaik's own illustrations that bring the characters and scenes to vivid life.

What distinguishes *Jaya* from other Mahabharata retellings is Pattanaik's commitment to plurality. He draws not only from Vyasa's Sanskrit original but from regional versions of the epic — Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, Javanese, and Thai — incorporating stories that mainstream retellings often ignore. The result is a Mahabharata that is richer, stranger, and more contradictory than any single version, reflecting the epic's true nature as a living, evolving tradition rather than a fixed text.

Pattanaik's authorial voice is distinctive — conversational, witty, and unafraid of drawing connections between ancient narratives and contemporary life. His footnotes and asides, which connect the stories to Indian art, ritual, folklore, and philosophy, transform the book from a mere retelling into a cultural education. The illustrations, simple but evocative, add a visual dimension that makes the book appealing to readers of all ages.

## Why Indian Readers Love This Book

For many Indian readers, the Mahabharata exists as fragments — stories heard from grandparents, episodes watched in the BR Chopra television series, or scenes depicted in temple sculptures. Pattanaik's *Jaya* provides the complete picture, connecting these fragments into a coherent whole. Indian readers particularly appreciate how he draws from regional traditions, validating versions of the story that are often overshadowed by the pan-Indian "standard" narrative. The book has become a gift-giving staple — the book you buy for someone who wants to "finally read the whole Mahabharata."

## Who Should Read This

- Anyone who wants a complete, accessible retelling of the Mahabharata that respects the epic's complexity without being intimidating
- Parents and educators looking for a version of the Mahabharata suitable for young adults that does not sanitize or oversimplify the story
- Readers interested in Indian mythology, art, and philosophy who appreciate an author who connects ancient texts to contemporary Indian culture
